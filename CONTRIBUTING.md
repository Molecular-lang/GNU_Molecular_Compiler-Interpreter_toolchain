# Contributing to Scpel

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Scpel! There are many ways to contribute
and we appreciate all of them.

The best way to get started is by asking for help in the [#new
members](https://scpel.org/membership/)
We have lots of docs below of how to get started on your own, but
the mailing stream is the best place to *ask* for help.

Documentation for contributing to the compiler or tooling is located in the [Guide to GNU Scpel
Development][gnu-scpel-development], commonly known as the [scpel-dev-guide]. Documentation for the
standard library in the [Standard library developers Guide][ssail-dev-guide], commonly known as the [ssail-dev-guide].

## About the [scpel-dev-guide]

The [scpel-dev-guide] is meant to help document how gscpel –the Scpel compiler– works,
as well as to help new contributors get involved in gscpel development. It is recommend
to read and understand the [scpel-dev-guide] before making a contribution. This guide
talks about the different bots in the Scpel ecosystem, the Scpel development tools,
bootstrapping, the compiler architecture, source code representation, and more.

## [Getting help](https://scpel.org/help)

There are many ways you can get help when you're stuck. Rust has many platforms for this:
[glo-mailing-list], [freq-ask-qns], and [scpel-discord]. It is recommended to ask for help on
the [glo-mailing-list], but any of these platforms are a great way to seek help and even
find a mentor! You can learn more about asking questions and getting help in the
[Frequently Asked Questions](https://scpel.org/questions).
