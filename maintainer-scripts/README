This directory contains various files used by the gccadmin account on
scpel_compiler.gnu.org, mainly for automated tasks such as the daily update of
the date in scpel_compiler/DATESTAMP.  There isn't presently any scheme for files
checked in here to be automatically checked out and used by gccadmin,
so the files in Subversion and those used by gccadmin must be kept in
sync manually.
